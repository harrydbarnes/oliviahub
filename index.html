            <h2>Making a Bottle</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure the formula machine water tub is more than half full, fill up the inside bit if not and then proceed. The machine won't work if not enough in it, but will let you start one if it is *just* above what you need, so make sure you top it up.</li>
                <li>Put bottle underneath, make sure number is on 6 and then press the middle button</li>
                <li>After 20 seconds roughly it'll pause. Put lid on and shake for 10 seconds. You have two minutes to do this, otherwise it'll reset.</li>
                <li>Then put back in, press button again.</li>
                <li>After another 30 seconds roughly it'll be done. Put lid on and it's good to go</li>

                <li>Needs feeding every 2 hours roughly, from start of last one.</li>

                <li>Clean bottles with dish soap and then rinse off, place in the tub. It needs 15 mins in there, but can stay in longer.</li>
